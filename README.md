- 👋 Hi, I’m @MikkoLam from Tampere, Finland.
- 👀 I’m interested in singing and playing live music, guitar, piano, bass drums and harmonica. Also excercising that's also fun. Like skiing, wakeboarding, windsurfing.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python language, also interested in learning android programming.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anyone who has crazy ideas. =D
- 📫 mikkolampinen@hotmail.com
